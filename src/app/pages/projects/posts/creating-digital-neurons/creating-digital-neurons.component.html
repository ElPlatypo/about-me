      After first learning about AI and Machine Learning, I decided that I
      wanted to know more about the subject. I was incredibly fascinated by it,
      yet also confused about how these algorithms work. Luckily for me, I found
      some good resources online that detailed the basics of machine learning,
      and I’d like to explain them here with a small interactive demo.

    <h2>Basic Building Blocks: Weighted Sums</h2>
    <p>
      Although today’s machine learning algorithms are incredibly sophisticated,
      they can often be broken down to a simple concept: weighted sums. Let's
      break this down with an example. Imagine we have a series of three numbers
      A, B, and C, each associated with a "weight" value. Let's call these
      weights w<sub>A</sub>, w<sub>B</sub>, and w<sub>C</sub>. To calculate the
      value of C, we could use weighted sums like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equation:</strong> The value of C is calculated by first
      multiplying A by its weight w<sub>A</sub>, then multiplying B by its
      weight w<sub>B</sub>, and so forth:
    </p>
    <p>C = (A &times; w<sub>A</sub>) &times; w<sub>B</sub></p>

      [layers]="3"
      [neuronsPerLayer]="[1, 1, 1]"
      [showWeights]="true"
      class="w-full"
    ></app-neural-network-visualizer>
    <h2>Processing Multiple Inputs</h2>
    <p>
      In machine learning, algorithms usually take multiple inputs instead of a
      single number. Let’s say our input consists of a set of numbers, like
      A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, and A<sub>3</sub>, each with their
      respective weights w<sub>A1</sub>, w<sub>A2</sub>, and w<sub>A3</sub>. We
      can compute a new value, B, as the sum of these weighted inputs:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equation:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      B = (A<sub>1</sub> &times; w<sub>A1</sub>) + (A<sub>2</sub> &times;
      w<sub>A2</sub>) + (A<sub>3</sub> &times; w<sub>A3</sub>)
    </p>
    <app-neural-network-visualizer
      [layers]="3"
      [neuronsPerLayer]="[3, 1, 1]"
      [showWeights]="true"
      class="w-full"
    ></app-neural-network-visualizer>

    <h2>Expanding to Layers of Neurons</h2>
    <p>
      In a neural network, this process can be repeated across multiple steps,
      or "layers." Each layer is made up of values called "neurons." Suppose the
      first layer has N neurons (such as A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ...,
      A<sub>N</sub>). If the next layer contains K neurons (say B<sub>1</sub>,
      B<sub>2</sub>, ..., B<sub>K</sub>), each neuron in the first layer will
      have K weights associated with it (like w<sub>1A1</sub>, w<sub>2A1</sub>,
      ..., w<sub>KA1</sub>). These weights are used to compute the values of the
      next layer.
    </p>
    <app-neural-network-visualizer
      [layers]="3"
      [neuronsPerLayer]="[3, 3, 3]"
      [showWeights]="false"
      class="w-full"
    ></app-neural-network-visualizer>

    <h2>Controlling Output Ranges with Activation Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Both the initial values (such as A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ...,
      A<sub>N</sub>) and the weights in a network can be positive or negative.
      As these values move through each layer, they may increase or decrease
      drastically, potentially reaching very large positive or negative numbers.
      To keep these values within a manageable range, we apply an
      <strong>activation function</strong> to the output of each layer. An
      activation function "squeezes" values into a set range, often between 0
      and 1. For instance, if the output of a layer is very negative, the
      activation function will return a value close to 0; if it's positive and
      large, it returns a value closer to 1.

      With all of this in mind here's the first demo that lets you play with a
      fixed size network:
