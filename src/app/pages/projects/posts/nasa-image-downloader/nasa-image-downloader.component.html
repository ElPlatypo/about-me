      This project started a few years ago when I wanted a new animated
      wallpaper for my desktop, and I fell down the rabbit hole of how to source
      and group images taken from space. My research started by looking for
      high-quality videos that I could directly use, but there didnâ€™t seem to be
      any good ones around. The next best thing I could do was compile a
      time-lapse of photos taken in succession from space, and luckily for me,
      the International Space Station, or ISS, has been doing just that for many
      years. There is a HUGE database of images that can be publicly and freely
      accessed over at jsc.nasa.gov, but unfortunately, the included search
      feature was not capable enough to fetch the kind of image sequences I was
      looking

      I then whipped up a simple Python script that will first download and
      build a local copy of the database on the site, but just with image
      metadata, to save on bandwidth, space, and time. Once the local database
      is built, the script allows the user to look for sequences of photos of at
      least a set length and taken at a specific delay from each other, offering
      to download a preview of the first image to rapidly gauge if the photos
      were taken at an interesting time.

      This is done because the cameras aboard the ISS arent always rolling,
      there might be a significant time skip between photos, and because the
      cameras are not always pointed at the earth, but searching for this kind
      of sequences was just not possible on the site.

      Once we select a sequence we like we can easily download it and compile it
      in a timelapse with the video editing software of choice. Here is one of
      the timelapses I compiled, with the ISS going over central Asia
