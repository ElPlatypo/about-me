      I recently started playing around with a DJ console as a hobby. I’ve
      always listened to a lot of music, so I’ve been curious to try this out
      for some time. One thing that I immediately realized is that in order to
      use any mixing software, one needs “physical” .mp3 (or similar) files,
      streaming them directly from places like Spotify or Apple Music is just
      not possible. The problem was that I’ve been using Spotify for many years
      at this point, so I stopped collecting mp3 files long ago, and I needed a
      way to fix this issue in an easy and automated way. There just aren’t good
      tools online to do this task already, and this is why I started working on
      this project.

      Spoodl is a simple Python script that aims to solve this very problem. Its
      use is to synchronize playlists on Spotify with a local folder of .mp3
      files. To use it, simply copy-paste the link to a Spotify playlist on the
      correct .txt file, and Spoodl will start using Spotify public APIs (this
      is the reason a Spotify developer account is needed, for more info, visit
      <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">
        Spotify's documentation
      </a>
      ) to fetch metadata from every song in the playlist and use that metadata
      to compile a search query on YouTube, find all possible matches on YouTube
      and prompt the user on what version to select, download and convert the
      selected video to an audio, and finally apply all the song metadata
      gathered from Spotify to the correct tags on the .mp3 file. Each time the
      script is run, it will detect changes made to the Spotify playlist and ask
      the user to delete or download new songs if needed. Making sure that the
      local files are an exact copy of the selected playlists
