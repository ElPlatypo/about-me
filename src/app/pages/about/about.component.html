    <h1>Who am i?</h1>
    <p>
      Heyo! 👋 I’m an enthusiastic explorer of all things tech. From coding to
      3D modeling, from game engines to DIY projects with microcontrollers, if a
      computer can do it, I probably want to learn about it. I have a deep
      passion for science and a small background in physics. I love to learn how
      the world around us works and how to apply this knowledge to solve
      practical problems.
    </p>
    <h1>What am I good at</h1>
    <p>
      Both during my years at university and in my free time, I had the time to
      learn and teach myself many different things, following my interests and
      never getting tired of learning about new topics.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Programming I first started getting into programming back when I was 15
        or so, and during these years I’ve had the time to experiment with many
        languages such as C++, C#, and a bit of Java, but I have the most
        experience with Rust and Python. I used these languages both for
        personal projects and courses at university, learning a lot while
        solving everyday problems with this new skill. Machine learning is a
        field I’ve been captivated by from the moment I first discovered it. The
        whole concept of replicating digitally how our brain works is still
        incredible to me, but after learning the basics of how these systems
        work, it’s possible to leverage the immense power that AI offers. I’ve
        worked a bit with different models and architectures, from
        transformer-based LLMs to diffusion-based image generators, taking
        advantage of the playground offered by Google at Colab and trying to run
        some of these models locally on my machine. Linux is a powerful
        environment to develop software. In order to write code, I’ve learned my
        way around interacting with the OS via command line and how to
        troubleshoot (let’s be honest) frequent problems, but after some initial
        struggling, I became more familiar with it, to the point of it becoming
        my daily-driver OS on my laptop. I managed for many years a personal
        Arch-based server, and I learned a bit about system management, remote
        infrastructure and service management tools like Docker, together with
        the basics of system security, cryptography, and privacy.

        Software & Tools Through my experiences and projects, I’ve learned that
        often the best way to solve a problem is not to bang your head against
        it until it is solved, but instead to know the right tools to achieve
        the desired result without reinventing the wheel every time or wasting
        time. Because of this, I’ve learned many tools and frameworks that have
        helped me with my projects in the past. Blender - 3D modeling,
        rendering, VFX compositing, functional prototyping This software is
        incredibly powerful, it started as a small open-source project to create
        3D geometry and grew to be almost industry standard in the world of 3D
        modeling, visual effects compositing, animation, and simulation. Here’s
        a small render I made: Unity 3D - Video game production, physics
        simulator Unity is a powerful game-engine, it combines all the tools you
        need to make intractable experiences, be they games or simulations. The
        language used in this engine is C#, and that’s where I’ve got my
        experience in this language. Here’s a snippet from a game I worked on,
        where a room layout is first procedurally generated, then populated with
        enemies: Root - Data analysis and graphing tool developed by CERN Root
        is a powerful framework primarily used at CERN to gather, analyze, and
        clean data coming from experiments. Adobe Premiere - Video editing Adobe
        Photoshop - Image editing and creation Microsoft Suite - Collection of
        programs used for office work Arduino IDE - Arduino board programming
        platform Frameworks - Various frameworks i worked with Transformers,
        matplotlib, pyrogram, fastapi, pandas, hugo, rasa, regex, latex, docker,
        arduino, numpy, wireshark.

        DIY and prototyping I always liked bringing to the real world ideas and
        projects I had in my mind, so I’ve learned many practical skills to
        achieve this goal. From the basics of electronic circuitry to playing
        around with Arduino’s to the correct way to operate big and dangerous
        power tools, just as much as in the digital space, knowing the right
        tool to use for any given task is half the job. I approach building
        stuff using iterative design, building prototypes and testing them to
        see what can be improved from firsthand experience.

    <h1>What do I like</h1>
    <p>Here’s a small list of my biggest interests</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Software I have always been fascinated by computers, understanding how
        they work and how I can control them is still one of my favorite
        activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Space Technologies Space is still the ultimate frontier for humanity, to
        be able to reach and stay among the stars, we have to come up with
        innovative tech and unorthodox solutions, pushing humanity to its limit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Machine Learning This is a field that has recently gained a lot of
        popularity, and I strongly believe that if used in the correct way and
        for the right problems, machine learning could be an invaluable asset in
        the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Music I always loved music, and I recently started trying my hand with a
        console and MIXXX. I don’t think I could spend an entire day of my life
        without listening to some music if you asked me to.
      </li>

        World Events We live in a chaotic world governed by interest, kindness,
        and greed. To make sense of our current situation, we have to look
        around us and back in time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Green Tech Climate change is probably the biggest challenge our
        generation will face. We have the power and the duty to reduce our
        impact on the climate, I’m always excited to learn about technologies
        that can help us achieve that.
      </li>
      <li>
        DIY Coding software is fun, but you know what’s better? Seeing the code
        you wrote influence stuff in the real world. Getting my hands dirty and
        building stuff by myself has to be one of my favorite activities, from
        building stuff I need myself to repairing devices I own to fight
        consumerism.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What do I believe in</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am a environmentalist, i believe that nature should be preserved and
        protected in any feasible way, and that it is a critical step we have to
        take as a species to ensure our continued survival. This being said, I
        also strongly believe that we have the tech, the knowledge, and the
        power to collectively work towards a greener future. Climate change is
        just a very complex problem that takes some out-of-the-box thinking to
        solve, but we’re up for the challenge.

        Technology is advancing incredibly fast in a million different and
        fascinating fields. It’s going to bring about a wealth of possibilities,
        but there also will be some risks. For this reason, it is important to
        engage in discussions on new and sometimes uncomfortable topics like AI
        to evaluate benefits and risks in advance. These things are arriving,
        whether we like it or not, and the least we can do is to be as prepared
        as possible, and the best way to be prepared is understanding how theese
        technologies work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Privacy is invaluable and especially online, I feel like we should be a
        bit more conscious of where our personal data goes and gets sold for
        profit.
      </li>
      <li>
        The world is an incredibly complex machine of cause and effect, to
        properly understand the situation, culture and economy we live in its
        essential to look at what is happening around us. Keeping up to date on
        current world events is incredibly fascinating to me and knowing the
        context, culture and history of a region or state is crucial to properly
        understanding what is going on there currently.
